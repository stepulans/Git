Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way.
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

Refrain:Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
Jingle, bells! Jingle, bells! Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
